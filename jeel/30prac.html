            <p>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of
                the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part
                of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate
                category from other natural phenomena.[1]</p>
            <p>The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, or
                "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".[2] In ancient
                philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which
                originally related to the intrinsic characteristics of plants, animals, and other features of the world
                to develop of their own accord.[3][4] The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of
                several expansions of the original notion;[1] it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις
                by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus),
                and has steadily gained currency ever since.</p>
