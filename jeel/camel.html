        <p>Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions,
            animals consume
            organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and go through an ontogenetic
            stage in which
            their body consists of a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5
            million living
            animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are
            over 7
            million animal species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres
            (110 ft). They
            have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The
            scientific study of
            animals is known as zoology.

            Most living animal species are in Bilateria, a clade whose members have a bilaterally symmetric body plan.
            The Bilateria
            include the protostomes, containing animals such as nematodes, arthropods, flatworms, annelids and molluscs,
            and the
            deuterostomes, containing the echinoderms and the chordates, the latter including the vertebrates. Life
            forms
            interpreted as early animals were present in the Ediacaran biota of the late Precambrian. Many modern animal
            phyla
            became clearly established in the fossil record as marine species during the Cambrian explosion, which began
            around 539
            million years ago. 6,331 groups of genes common to all living animals have been identified; these may have
            arisen from a
            single common ancestor that lived 650 million years ago.Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in
